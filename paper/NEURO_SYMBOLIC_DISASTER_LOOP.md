## Abstract

Modern assurance fails most often at composition boundaries. A parser, proof,
fuzz target, or model checker may be correct in isolation while the larger
workflow still reaches a disaster state through stale evidence, retry paths,
optional features, provenance drift, proof-journal mismatch, or promotion from an
unsafe research state. This paper introduces **what-if witness spaces**: a
general neuro-symbolic technique in which a creative proposer generates explicit
disaster hypotheses and a deterministic symbolic checker decides whether each
hypothesis is blocked, refuted, or reachable under replayable evidence.

The method generalizes counterexample-guided reasoning from local program inputs
to the assurance workflow itself. The neural side is an existential generator:
it asks "what if?" over surfaces, graph edges, evidence states, and fault
mutations. The symbolic side is a universal gate: it checks every generated
witness in a bounded language, rejects unknown or stale evidence fail-closed, and
opens research only when all obligations are discharged. The mathematical core
comes from witness-space factorization, quantifier factoring, Galois-style
obligation carving, verifier-compiler loops, and loop-space geometry.

The primary case study is MPRD, where the loop checked 16,003 materialized
what-ifs plus a compressed 75,599,999-combination independent frontier, found 0
reachable disaster witnesses, observed 0 fail-closed failures across receipt,
blocker, provenance, and optional-conflict mutations, and opened the bounded
research gate. An illustrative second application, ZenoDEX, shows how the same
loop shape applies to loss-bearing financial witness spaces: settlement
certificates, oracle freshness, nonce replay, integer rounding, sealed-bid
terminal states, confidential receipts, proof gates, and claim-evidence routing.
The claim is intentionally bounded: it proves no global software safety theorem.
It reports a replayable no-witness result over the MPRD artifact set for a
named witness language, atlas, receipt set, checker, and depth. The result is
checker-relative and witness-language-relative. The ZenoDEX section is an
illustrative extension unless its full archive is included.

## The Assurance Gap

Most software hardening workflows are organized around local artifacts:

- unit tests for local invariants,
- fuzz targets for parsers and state machines,
- concolic or symbolic checks for branchy code,
- proof files for selected mathematical claims,
- CI gates for regressions.

These are necessary, but they do not fully model the composed assurance process.
Real failures often arise between artifacts:

- a receipt is valid for an old checker but reused after the checker changes,
- a proof journal is replayed against a different decision token,
- a retry path re-enters replay clearance after side effects,
- a stable optional-lane receipt disagrees with the atlas,
- a promotion gate treats "no bug found" as "safe to research."

These are not only code bugs. They are **disaster states** in the process that
decides which states may be explored, optimized, or promoted. The key question is
therefore:

$$
\text{Which bad composed states are reachable under the current evidence state?}
$$

The answer must not depend on whether a language model is confident. It must
depend on a finite, reproducible witness space and a deterministic checker.

## The Technique

A **what-if witness space** is a finite or compressed symbolic family of
hypotheses. A hypothesis names:

- the surfaces involved,
- the disaster state being tested,
- the composition, ordering, re-entry, or evidence-fault pattern,
- the receipt or checker evidence required to decide it.

The loop has two roles:

1. The proposer generates hypotheses. This can be an LLM, a human reviewer, a
   grammar, a fuzzer, or another search policy. It is creative, but not trusted.
2. The checker classifies hypotheses. It is deterministic, receipt-backed, and
   fail-closed. It owns promotion authority.

The operational rule is:

$$
\text{Creativity belongs on the existential side; trust belongs on the
universal side.}
$$

The proposer searches for possible witnesses. The checker decides which
witnesses are valid, blocked, or refuted. If the checker returns `UNKNOWN`,
`TIMEOUT`, `INCONCLUSIVE`, malformed input, stale evidence, or missing evidence,
the gate rejects.

## Positioning and Related Work

The technique is related to several established lines of formal-methods and
security-engineering work, but its object of analysis is different.
Counterexample-guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) refines an abstraction
after a spurious counterexample appears [1]. Counterexample-guided inductive
synthesis (CEGIS) alternates synthesis and verification over candidate programs
[2]. Abstract interpretation supplies the lattice and Galois-connection
vocabulary for sound approximation [3]. Symbolic execution and concolic testing
generate inputs that explore program paths [4,5,6]. Fuzzing uses generated
inputs and feedback to explore program behavior [7]. SMT solvers and proof
assistants provide checkable proof or refutation infrastructure [8,9].
Proof-carrying code and runtime verification place trust in independently
checkable evidence rather than producer intent [10,11].

The contribution here is not a replacement for these methods. It is a workflow
layer above them. The witness space ranges over composed assurance states:
receipts, evidence freshness, blocker provenance, optional-lane conflicts,
promotion gates, and cross-surface disaster hypotheses. The "neural" or human
component is only a proposer of dangerous questions. The symbolic layer remains
the authority. In that sense, the paper is closest to a neuro-symbolic workflow
pattern: neural or human search proposes candidates, and symbolic systems filter
or reject them under explicit semantics [12].

## Mathematical Foundations

This section distills the mathematical machinery developed in the Formal Methods
Philosophy tutorial sequence on neuro-symbolic witness spaces, quantifier
factoring, Galois loops, verifier-compiler loops, loop-space geometry,
counterexample-guided requirements discovery, grammar-based fuzzing, and
concolic branch exploration.

### Witness Spaces

Let $x$ be an assurance state. It contains code, specifications, receipts,
provenance, optional guidance, checker state, and a bounded search depth. Let
$L$ be a witness language and $z$ a concrete witness object generated by that
language. A local witnessability target is:

$$
\mathrm{Good}(x)\;\Longleftrightarrow\;\exists z\;\mathrm{Proves}_{L}(z,x).
$$

For hardening, the more useful dual is a no-bad-witness target:

$$
\mathrm{NoBadWitness}(x,L)
\;\Longleftrightarrow\;
\neg\exists z\in L(x)\;\mathrm{Bad}(z,x).
$$

The technique does not search the full semantic universe. It searches $L(x)$,
the bounded witness language currently declared by the artifact. A no-witness
result is therefore:

$$
\neg\exists z\in L_d(x)\;\mathrm{ReachableDisaster}(z,x),
$$

where $d$ is the configured depth. This is meaningful because $L_d$ is explicit
and replayable, not because it is universal.

### Neuro-Symbolic Filtering

Let $q_N(z\mid x)$ be the proposer's distribution over candidate witnesses, and
let $\chi_S(z,x)$ be the symbolic admissibility predicate:

$$
\chi_S(z,x)=
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if the checker accepts } z \text{ for } x,\\
0 & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

The neuro-symbolic distribution is:

$$
q_{NS}(z\mid x)\propto q_N(z\mid x)\cdot \chi_S(z,x).
$$

This equation captures the division of labor. The proposer concentrates search
mass. The checker zeros out semantically invalid mass. The combined loop searches
the admissible overlap. If the admissible mass is zero, the distribution is not
renormalized into a pass; the gate reports that no admissible candidate was
found.

### Quantifier Factoring

Many assurance goals have the form:

$$
\exists a\;\forall e\;\mathrm{Spec}(a,e),
$$

where $a$ is a design, repair, policy, invariant, or research state, and $e$ is
an environment move, attack, execution, input, or evidence perturbation. The
central factoring move is:

$$
\forall e\;\mathrm{Spec}(a,e)
\;\Longleftrightarrow\;
\neg\exists e\;\neg\mathrm{Spec}(a,e).
$$

Thus acceptance is operationalized as failed counterexample search:

$$
\mathrm{Good}(a) := \forall e\;\mathrm{Spec}(a,e).
$$

$$
\mathrm{Accept}(a)
\;\Longleftrightarrow\;
\neg\exists e\;\mathrm{EmitCE}(a,e).
$$

Counterexample soundness is:

$$
\forall a,e\;(\mathrm{EmitCE}(a,e)\rightarrow\neg\mathrm{Spec}(a,e)).
$$

Counterexample completeness is:

$$
\forall a\;(\neg\mathrm{Good}(a)\rightarrow\exists e\;\mathrm{EmitCE}(a,e)).
$$

Only with both soundness and completeness does acceptance equal goodness. In
bounded engineering artifacts, completeness is usually limited to the declared
frontier. Therefore the honest claim is bounded acceptance, not global safety.

### Galois-Style Obligation Carving

The loop can be expressed as a Galois connection between candidate states and
obligations. Let $X$ be candidate states and $Y$ be obligations, and let
$\mathrm{Spec}:X\times Y\to\{\mathrm{true},\mathrm{false}\}$ be the Boolean
incidence relation. For $B\subseteq Y$ and $C\subseteq X$, define:

$$
\Phi(B)=\{x\in X\mid \forall b\in B,\;\mathrm{Spec}(x,b)\},
$$

$$
\Psi(C)=\{y\in Y\mid \forall x\in C,\;\mathrm{Spec}(x,y)\}.
$$

Then:

$$
C\subseteq \Phi(B)\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad B\subseteq\Psi(C).
$$

This means candidate-space reasoning and obligation-space reasoning are dual.
The closure operators are:

$$
\mathrm{cl}_X(C)=\Phi(\Psi(C)),
\qquad
\mathrm{cl}_Y(B)=\Psi(\Phi(B)).
$$

A fail-closed assurance loop maintains surviving candidates $C_t$, uncovered
obligations $U_t$, and discharged obligations $D_t=Y\setminus U_t$ with the
invariant:

$$
D_t\subseteq\Psi(C_t).
$$

Every discharged obligation must be satisfied by every surviving candidate. A
new bad witness shrinks $C_t$. A new region certificate shrinks $U_t$. A missing
receipt or inconclusive verifier result does not shrink the obligation set; it
keeps the gate closed.

### Obligation-Targeted Witness Routing

A stronger version of the loop is not "the proposer guesses an answer and the
checker attacks it." This architecture lets the symbolic side choose the
highest-value unresolved obligation, then asks the existential side to route the
search toward a witness that exposes it.

For an uncovered obligation $y$, define:

$$
W(C,y)=\{x\in C\mid \neg\mathrm{Spec}(x,y)\}.
$$

If $y\notin\Psi(C)$, then $W(C,y)$ is nonempty. A closure-gain score is:

$$
\Delta_\Psi(y\mid C)
=
\left|\Psi(C\cap\Phi(\{y\}))\right|
-
\left|\Psi(C)\right|.
$$

A live-burden score is:

$$
L(C)=|C|+|Y\setminus\Psi(C)|.
$$

On finite bounded domains, an obligation-targeted controller can choose $y$ by
maximizing closure gain or minimizing live burden, then require the proposer to
synthesize an exposing witness in $W(C,y)$. This is a deeper neuro-symbolic
loop: the formal side chooses the leverage-bearing question, and the creative
side supplies a concrete route to it.

### Verifier-Compiler View

Let $L^\star:X\to\Lambda$ be an exact verifier label function over a bounded
domain. A verifier-compiler loop searches for a quotient:

$$
q:X\to Q
$$

such that:

$$
\forall x,x'\in X,\;q(x)=q(x')\rightarrow L^\star(x)=L^\star(x').
$$

If this holds, there exists a compiled controller on the image of $q$:

$$
C:q(X)\to\Lambda
$$

with:

$$
\forall x\in X,\;C(q(x))=L^\star(x).
$$

If $q$ is too coarse, the loop adds a repair coordinate $r:X\to R$ and checks:

$$
(q(x),r(x))=(q(x'),r(x'))\rightarrow L^\star(x)=L^\star(x').
$$

The disaster loop uses this idea at the assurance level. It does not need every
byte of the repository. It needs a quotient that preserves the gate-relevant
observations: surfaces, edges, receipts, optional status, blocker references,
provenance, checker cleanliness, and depth.

### Loop-Space Geometry

The loop-space geometry view treats the assurance workflow as a state machine.
A state contains code, receipts, checker logic, provenance, optional guidance,
and gate decisions. A transition is an edit, rerun, receipt mutation, synthetic
fault, or witness-space expansion.

For a witness library $W$ and hidden target $M$, define the observation map:

$$
O_W(M)=\{S\in W\mid S\subseteq M\}.
$$

Two targets are indistinguishable to the current loop when:

$$
M\sim_W M'\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad O_W(M)=O_W(M').
$$

A stronger loop changes this quotient. It collects witnesses, stores the right
state, collapses ambiguity classes, asks only the residual questions that still
matter, and compiles the surviving structure into a small controller or gate.

For hardening, a disaster loop is a cycle:

$$
x_0\to x_1\to\cdots\to x_k
\quad\wedge\quad
x_k\sim_{\mathrm{visible}}x_0
\quad\wedge\quad
\mathrm{ObligationLost}(x_0,x_k).
$$

The method blocks such loops by making obligations visible. A stale receipt,
dirty checker, failed optional lane, or missing blocker changes the quotient and
therefore cannot silently return to the same researchable state.

### Loss-Bearing Witness Spaces

Financial protocols add a useful refinement. A disaster is not only an invariant
violation; it can be a reachable state with positive extractable value, stalled
settlement, stale oracle use, replay acceptance, rounding leakage, or unbound
receipt execution. Let $V$ be a value accounting map and let
$\mathrm{AllowedFlow}$ be the value flow explicitly authorized by the protocol
rules. Define the unexplained value movement of a witness by:

$$
\mathrm{Leak}(z,x)
=
\max\{0,\;V_{\mathrm{after}}(z,x)-V_{\mathrm{before}}(x)
-\mathrm{AllowedFlow}(z,x)\}.
$$

A financial disaster witness is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{LossWitness}(z,x)\Longleftrightarrow\;&
\mathrm{Reachable}(z,x)\\
&\wedge\;(\mathrm{BreaksConservation}(z,x)
\vee \mathrm{AcceptsReplay}(z,x)\\
&\quad\vee\;\mathrm{ExecutesStaleOracle}(z,x)
\vee \mathrm{ReceiptUnbound}(z,x)\\
&\quad\vee\;\mathrm{RoundingLeak}(z,x)
\vee \mathrm{StuckValueState}(z,x))\\
&\wedge\;\mathrm{Leak}(z,x)>0.
\end{aligned}
$$

The standard reading is: a witness matters financially when it is reachable,
hits a bad mechanism class, and moves value outside the allowed accounting
rules. This separates "the proof has not covered this case yet" from "this case
can lose money." Both can block promotion, but they carry different remediation
work.

For a financial surface, the witness language decomposes into typed fibers:

$$
L_{\mathrm{fin}} =
L_{\mathrm{exec}}\cup L_{\mathrm{acct}}\cup L_{\mathrm{oracle}}
\cup L_{\mathrm{receipt}}\cup L_{\mathrm{privacy}}
\cup L_{\mathrm{liveness}}\cup L_{\mathrm{governance}}.
$$

Each fiber has its own checker shape. Arithmetic conservation may route to a
proof assistant or SMT solver. Oracle freshness may route to a temporal model
and runtime gate. Sealed-bid deadlocks may route to state-machine replay.
Receipt binding may route to deterministic packet verification. The loop is
stronger when the witness language records this routing explicitly instead of
treating all "what ifs" as one undifferentiated fuzz queue.

### Claim-Evidence Routing

The ZenoDEX case study also motivates a claim-evidence graph. Let $C$ be
promoted claims, $E_v$ be evidence artifacts, and
$R\subseteq C\times E_v$ connect claims to replayable checks. A claim is
promotable only when every required evidence class has a passing artifact:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Promotable}(c)\Longleftrightarrow\;&
\mathrm{Status}(c)\in\{\mathrm{supported},\mathrm{proved}\}\\
&\wedge\;\forall k\in K(c)\;\exists e\in E_v\;.\;R(c,e)\\
&\wedge\;\mathrm{Kind}(e)=k\wedge\mathrm{Pass}(e).
\end{aligned}
$$

If any required evidence is missing, stale, disputed, inconclusive, or tied to
private scratch state that cannot be replayed, the public claim does not
promote. This is the same neuro-symbolic loop at a higher layer: the proposer
suggests a claim and its expected evidence route; the checker treats the
claim-evidence graph as state and rejects unsupported promotion.

## Generic Algorithm

The method can be implemented with the following abstract interface.

```text
input:
  surfaces S
  composition edges E
  re-entry edges Q
  disaster predicates D
  mandatory evidence Rm
  optional evidence Ro
  blocker references B
  provenance state P
  depth d

generate:
  W_mat:
    single-surface disasters
    evidence fail-open mutations
    blocker bypasses
    edge compositions
    order inversions
    bounded chains
    terminal chain disasters
    fan-out and convergence cases
    re-entry and cycle amplification cases
    independent co-reachability cases

  W_cmp:
    compressed independent frontier above the materialized order

mutate:
  receipt-state faults
  blocker-state faults
  provenance faults
  optional source-of-truth conflicts

classify:
  for every w in W_mat:
    REACHABLE_DISASTER_WITNESS
    UNKNOWN_BLOCKED
    NO_REACHABLE_WITNESS_BOUNDED

gate:
  open only if:
    no reachable disaster witnesses
    no unknown mandatory blockers
    no optional research blockers
    graph frontier exhausted
    synthetic fault checks reject fail-closed
    receipt provenance has no hard mismatch
    gate-critical checker state is clean
```

The generic gate can be written:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Open}(A,\varepsilon,d)\Longleftrightarrow\;&
\forall w\in W_{\mathrm{mat}}(A,d)\;.\;\rho(w,\varepsilon)\\
&\wedge\;\mathrm{CompressedFrontierOK}(W_{\mathrm{cmp}},\varepsilon)\\
&\wedge\;\mathrm{DepthExhausted}(A,d)\\
&\wedge\;\forall m\in M\;.\;\mathrm{Reject}(m(\varepsilon)).
\end{aligned}
$$

Here $A$ is the atlas, $\varepsilon$ is the evidence state, $\rho$ is the
researchability predicate, and $M$ is the synthetic mutation suite.

## Case Study: MPRD

MPRD is used here as a case study, not as the definition of the technique. In
the case study, the atlas is:

$$
A=(S,E,Q,D),
$$

where $S$ is the finite set of surfaces, $E\subseteq S\times S$ is the
composition graph, $Q\subseteq S\times S$ is the re-entry graph, and $D(s)$ is
the finite set of named disaster states attached to surface $s$.

The evidence state is:

$$
\varepsilon=(R_m,R_o,B,H,g,\Delta),
$$

where $R_m$ is the mandatory receipt set, $R_o$ is the optional receipt set,
$B$ is the blocker-source relation, $H$ is the harness-reference relation, $g$
is the current git head, and $\Delta$ is checker worktree/provenance status.

The current case-study atlas covers 11 surfaces:

| Surface | Example disaster states |
| --- | --- |
| `replay_nonce_claim` | duplicate side effects, nonce claimed twice, distributed claim race |
| `quorum_snapshot_attestation` | untrusted threshold, duplicate signer, drifted snapshot |
| `orchestrator_pipeline_ordering` | verify-fail-but-execute, record-before-verify, duplicate payload |
| `selector_candidate_family` | noncanonical family, out-of-bounds selection, hash mismatch |
| `operator_control_lifecycle` | invalid retention mutation, mode transition drift |
| `decision_token_proof_journal_binding` | decision commitment drift, journal state drift |
| `policy_artifact_run_lifecycle` | unauthorized artifact, source mapping gap, tamper |
| `registry_key_rotation_authorization` | insufficient quorum, rotated key still authorizes |
| `tau_policy_certification_boundary` | unsupported policy fail-open, tampered Tau certifies |
| `executor_side_effect_boundary` | invalid boundary reaches side effect, idempotency drift |
| `executor_transport_boundary` | invalid boundary reaches network, retry budget drift |

The materialized case-study witness language is:

$$
\begin{aligned}
W_{\mathrm{mat}}(A,d)=&
W_{\mathrm{single}}\cup W_{\mathrm{receipt}}\cup W_{\mathrm{blocker}}
\cup W_{\mathrm{edge}}\cup W_{\mathrm{order}}\\
&\cup W_{\mathrm{chain}}\cup W_{\mathrm{fan}}\cup W_{\mathrm{conv}}
\cup W_{\mathrm{reentry}}\cup W_{\mathrm{cycle}}
\cup W_{\mathrm{independent}}^{\le 3}.
\end{aligned}
$$

The compressed frontier is:

$$
W_{\mathrm{cmp}}(A,d)=
\{I\subseteq S\mid 4\le |I|\le d,\; I
\text{ is independent under the atlas relations}\}.
$$

$$
\mathrm{Open}(A,\varepsilon,11)
\Rightarrow
\neg\exists w\in W_{\mathrm{mat}}(A,11)\;
\mathrm{ReachableDisaster}(w,\varepsilon).
$$

It is not:

$$
\neg\exists w\in W_{\infty}(A)\;
\mathrm{ReachableDisaster}(w,\varepsilon).
$$

### Checker-Relative Proof Sketch

This theorem is checker-relative. It is not an independent proof that real
executions contain no disaster states. It states what follows from the archived
checker relation and receipt.

Let $C(w,\varepsilon)$ be the deterministic classification relation implemented
by the checker for a witness $w$ and evidence state $\varepsilon$. Let
$G(A,\varepsilon,d)$ be the strict gate predicate that requires:

- every materialized witness in $W_{\mathrm{mat}}(A,d)$ to be classified as
  non-reachable or bounded-safe,
- zero reachable disaster witnesses,
- zero unknown mandatory blockers,
- exhausted bounded graph frontier,
- successful fail-closed synthetic mutation checks,
- acceptable receipt provenance,
- compact/full receipt parity,
- and a clean gate-critical checker state.

Then the checker-relative theorem is:

$$
G(A,\varepsilon,d)
\Rightarrow
\neg\exists w\in W_{\mathrm{mat}}(A,d)\;.\;
C(w,\varepsilon)=\mathrm{ReachableDisaster}.
$$

Proof sketch. The strict gate predicate contains the universal scan over
$W_{\mathrm{mat}}(A,d)$ and the zero-count reachable-disaster condition. The
recorded receipt fixes the atlas, evidence state, materialized witness family,
classification counts, synthetic mutation outcomes, and stable hash. Compact
and full receipt parity checks that the compact artifact did not omit
gate-relevant content. Therefore, under the assumptions that the archived
checker exactly evaluates $C$ and that the receipt hash matches the published
artifact, an emitted `OPEN_FOR_BOUNDED_RESEARCH` result entails that no
materialized witness was classified as reachable by that checker. This is a
relative soundness claim about the checker and witness language; it is not a
semantic completeness claim about all possible executions.

## Illustrative Second Application: ZenoDEX Financial-Risk Hardening

ZenoDEX is used here as an illustrative second application because financial
protocols make the stakes of compositional disaster states concrete. The present
preprint archive includes the compact MPRD receipt bundle, not a full ZenoDEX
evidence bundle. The purpose of this section is therefore methodological: it
shows how the same witness-space discipline extends to a financial protocol
surface.

The value-moving surface includes batch settlement, quote and settlement
receipts, oracle freshness, nonce sequencing, rounding and dust handling,
proof-gated settlement updates, perpetual-market epoch settlement, confidential
extension receipts, and sealed-bid auction terminal states.

The useful abstraction is:

$$
x_{\mathrm{dex}} =
(\sigma_{\mathrm{ledger}},\sigma_{\mathrm{oracle}},
\sigma_{\mathrm{receipt}},\sigma_{\mathrm{claim}},
\sigma_{\mathrm{proof}},\sigma_{\mathrm{time}}).
$$

The standard reading is: the DEX assurance state is not just balances and pools.
It also includes oracle time, receipt roots, promoted claims, proof/binding
state, and temporal queue state. A what-if loop must perturb all of these
coordinates, because many DeFi failures occur in the composition of otherwise
reasonable modules.

The ZenoDEX evidence structure inspected for this paper includes:

- a tool-agnostic claims registry that marks promoted, supported, proved, and
  disputed claims with replay commands,
- public replay lanes that separate tracked manifests and checker scripts from
  private scratch evidence,
- proof-carrying settlement witness kernels for exact-in and exact-out
  settlement,
- deterministic tests for minimal economic witnesses such as rounding leakage
  and reward-subsidized oracle manipulation,
- machine-checked proofs for nonce replay, canonical route selection, rounding,
  CPMM settlement, and batch-auction canonicalization,
- bounded temporal models for oracle recovery, settlement witness lifecycle,
  exact-out fallback liveness, liquidation queue drain, and settlement witness
  inclusion under bounded ingress, reorg, fee-priority, and builder-pressure
  assumptions,
- a sealed-bid disaster-state catalog covering empty-auction, no-reveal, and
  empty-bond terminal paths,
- confidential extension and FHE sealed-bid alpha boundaries that require
  freshness, binding, replay protection, local output bounds, and explicit
  fallback paths.

This adds three lessons beyond the MPRD case study.

First, financial witness languages must include value functions. A state can be
syntactically valid and still be unacceptable if it enables positive extraction
or creates value outside authorized accounting:

$$
\exists z\in L_{\mathrm{fin}}(x)\;.\;
\mathrm{Reachable}(z,x)\wedge \mathrm{Leak}(z,x)>0
\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\mathrm{RejectPromotion}(x).
$$

Second, liveness can be a safety property when value is locked or risk keeps
accumulating. A "safe" fail-closed state that never settles can become a
financial disaster. Therefore the loop must ask not only "can a bad transition
execute?" but also "can an accepted witness remain unresolved past the bounded
fairness assumptions?"

Third, public claims need explicit exclusion. ZenoDEX's assurance surface
distinguishes release-backed, public-replay, disputed, experimental, and
out-of-scope surfaces. This is essential for publishable assurance: an
incomplete proof lane becomes an honest boundary, not a hidden global
claim.

The bounded ZenoDEX-style gate can be written:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{Open}_{\mathrm{fin}}(x,d)\Longleftrightarrow\;&
\neg\exists z\in L_{\mathrm{fin},d}(x)\;.\;
\mathrm{LossWitness}(z,x)\\
&\wedge\;\forall c\in C_{\mathrm{promoted}}\;.\;
\mathrm{Promotable}(c)\\
&\wedge\;\forall c\in C_{\mathrm{disputed}}\;.\;
\neg\mathrm{ReleaseAuthoritative}(c)\\
&\wedge\;\mathrm{ReplayLanesGreen}(x)
\wedge\mathrm{PrivateScratchExcluded}(x).
\end{aligned}
$$

This is a financial version of the same technique. A separately archived
ZenoDEX release would not claim that a live DEX is universally safe. It would
claim only that, for a named bounded surface, no generated
loss-bearing witness survives replay; every promoted claim has its required
evidence route; disputed claims stay excluded; and private or experimental
tooling is not part of the public proof.

## Replication Protocol

The public replication path has three tiers for the archived MPRD case study:
a focused paper bundle, a compact receipt replay, and an upstream full
case-study regeneration path. A ZenoDEX replay is optional when the ZenoDEX
repository or archive is available.

  --md /tmp/neuro_symbolic_disaster_loop_latest.md
```

- Known scope limit: the theorem is checker-relative and
  witness-language-relative.

### Tier 1: Paper Bundle Availability

Clone the repository archive associated with the Zenodo release:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheDarkLightX/what-if-witness-spaces
cd what-if-witness-spaces
```

Verify the archived receipt summary:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_receipt.py
```

This tier checks that the DOI release contains the paper source, publication
PDF, compact receipt, and the hash-stable receipt verifier.

### Tier 2: Case-Study Receipt Replay

The case-study receipt is `neuro_symbolic_disaster_loop_latest.json` in
`artifact/neuro_symbolic_case_study/`.

For the compact MPRD receipt included in this Zenodo release, verify the
recorded stable hash:

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import json
from pathlib import Path
p = Path("artifact/neuro_symbolic_case_study")
p = p / "neuro_symbolic_disaster_loop_latest.json"
d = json.loads(p.read_text())
print(d["stable_receipt_hash"])
print(json.dumps(d["summary"], indent=2, sort_keys=True))
print(json.dumps(d["gate_summary"], indent=2, sort_keys=True))
PY
```

The expected stable hash for the case-study receipt used in this paper is:

```text
b83ee1178c4bea460b9c7e3c67d5ccf1d7ac330e017746236fcfc7274c459561
```

### Tier 3: Full Case-Study Regeneration

To regenerate the MPRD case-study receipt from the archived evidence bundle,
use the upstream MPRD repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheDarkLightX/MPRD
cd MPRD
```

Then run:

```bash
python3 tools/run_neuro_symbolic_disaster_loop.py \
  --strict-research-gate \
  --json /tmp/neuro_symbolic_disaster_loop_latest.json \
  --md /tmp/neuro_symbolic_disaster_loop_latest.md
```

To materialize full per-hypothesis arrays:

```bash
python3 tools/run_neuro_symbolic_disaster_loop.py \
  --strict-research-gate \
  --full-results \
  --json /tmp/neuro_symbolic_disaster_loop_full.json \
  --md /tmp/neuro_symbolic_disaster_loop_full.md
```

Any compact/full regeneration is acceptable only if both modes agree on the
stable semantic hash. If they do not, the compact receipt is not acceptable
evidence.

No private hypothesis generator is required for these replication tiers. Private
or experimental tools may help generate new what-if candidates, but public
claims require deterministic receipts that can be checked from the archived
artifact set.

### Optional ZenoDEX Application Replay

When the ZenoDEX repository or a Zenodo archive of it is available, the same
paper claims can be inspected through its public replay surface:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheDarkLightX/ZenoDEX
cd ZenoDEX
python3 tools/permissionless_assurance.py status
python3 tools/build_stateful_disaster_search_expansion_plan.py --format json
python3 tools/sealed_bid_disaster_catalog.py
```

The expected public posture is not "all DEX behavior is proved." The expected
posture is that the repository declares its promoted claim boundary, exposes
replay commands for promoted claims, records disputed or experimental surfaces
honestly, and makes named financial disaster witnesses executable or checkable
under bounded assumptions.

## What This Proves

Within the checker-relative scope stated above, the result proves bounded
statements about a named witness language and evidence state.

### Claim 1: Bounded No-Witness Result

Given the case-study atlas, receipts, checker, generated hypothesis family,
exhausted depth-11 frontier, and strict gate conditions, the archived run proves
that no materialized generated hypothesis has a reachable disaster witness under
the checker.

### Claim 2: Fail-Closed Evidence Handling

The archived run proves that every implemented synthetic receipt, blocker,
provenance, and optional-conflict mutation is handled according to the expected
fail-closed policy. Missing mandatory evidence, failed receipts, artifact drift,
unreferenced blocker symbols, stale hard provenance, and blocking optional
receipts reject.

### Claim 3: Research Permission Is Conditional

Research permission is not inferred from absence of a found bug. It requires
absence of reachable witnesses, absence of unknown mandatory blockers, absence of
optional research blockers, exhausted graph frontier, successful synthetic
fail-closed checks, acceptable provenance, and a clean gate-critical checker.

### Claim 4: Compact Receipt Soundness for This Gate

The compact and full receipt modes agree on a stable timestamp-free hash for the
same semantic content. This supports compact archival without silently dropping
gate-relevant content.

## What This Does Not Prove

The method does not prove global software safety.

It does not prove:

- that the atlas contains every possible disaster state,
- that the generated witness language is complete,
- that all real executions are bounded by the modeled frontier,
- that every underlying fuzz or symbolic campaign was exhaustive,
- that every harness perfectly refines production behavior,
- that the checker has been machine-proved correct,
- that future code changes preserve the result,
- that cryptographic, network, OS, compiler, or deployment assumptions hold,
- that absence of a generated witness means absence of vulnerability,
- that the ZenoDEX case-study observations prove a live DeFi deployment safe
  without its own current release archive, configuration, keys, oracle
  assumptions, and replayed evidence.

It also does not give the LLM authority. The LLM or human proposer may suggest
cases, but a case is only promotable after deterministic replay says it is
promotable. Unknown is not a weak pass; it is a reject.

## Design Principles

The technique suggests several reusable design principles.

### Make Disaster States Concrete

Concrete names make harnesses, receipts, and blockers auditable. For example:

- `verify_fail_but_execute`
- `duplicate_side_effect_after_claim`
- `unauthorized_policy_artifact_materializes`

These names are more useful than generic "security bug" labels because they
identify the composed state that must be blocked.

### Separate Witness Absence From Research Permission

No witness found is not the same as safe to research. Research permission also
requires evidence freshness, optional-lane stability, clean checker state, and
frontier exhaustion.

### Treat Evidence as State

Receipts, provenance, optional guidance, and checker cleanliness are not
bookkeeping outside the assurance protocol. They are state variables in the
protocol.

### Compile Verifier Structure, Not Trust

Verifier-compiler loops may produce quotients, summaries, controllers, or
compact gates. These artifacts can reduce work, but final authority remains with
the deterministic checker and replayable evidence.

### Keep Private Search Separate From Public Evidence

Private tools may be useful for finding ideas, but public claims must be
reconstructible from public artifacts, standard runtimes, and deterministic
receipts.

## AI and Tool-Use Disclosure

Large language models were used as proposer and drafting assistants during the
development of this work. They helped suggest what-if hypotheses, organize the
technical report, and revise prose. They did not have promotion authority. The
reported case-study claims depend on deterministic scripts, archived receipts,
hashes, and replayable checks, not on an LLM's confidence. The author reviewed
and accepts responsibility for the final text and claims.

## Future Work

- Publish a generic schema for danger atlases, receipts, and what-if witness
  families independent of the MPRD codebase.
- Add graph-topology mutations: missing edge, inverted edge, duplicate edge,
  re-entry promoted to composition, and self-loop-at-surface.
- Upgrade all receipt schemas to carry provenance and content hashes.
- Connect selected gate claims to public Lean or SMT obligations where the
  checker logic is small enough to formalize.
- Generate minimal counterexample packets automatically when a reachable witness
  appears.
- Study obligation-targeted witness routing as a scheduling policy for
  LLM-assisted security review.
- Release a standalone ZenoDEX financial-risk case-study bundle with the same
  archival shape as the MPRD receipt bundle.

The Zenodo DOI for this preprint and compact artifact bundle is
10.5281/zenodo.19763921.

The ZenoDEX case study is described as a second application of the technique.
Its full reproducibility depends on a separately released ZenoDEX repository or
archive. This Zenodo archive does not contain the full ZenoDEX evidence set
unless those artifacts are explicitly included in the published archive.

## Relationship to Formal Methods Philosophy Tutorials

This paper packages the following tutorial ideas into a software-hardening
method:

- **Neuro-symbolic witness spaces:** LLMs and humans act as existential
  candidate generators; symbolic systems act as semantic filters.
- **Quantifier factoring:** universal assurance obligations become explicit
  counterexample searches over negated specifications.
- **Galois loops and obligation carving:** candidate spaces and obligation
  spaces are dual; progress must be measured on both sides.
- **Verifier-compiler loops:** repeated verifier behavior can sometimes be
  compressed into a quotient, repair coordinate, or controller, while final
  authority remains with the exact checker.
- **Loop-space geometry:** strong loops reshape the remaining search problem by
  changing witness language, stored state, ambiguity quotient, separator policy,
  and target artifact.
- **Counterexample-guided requirements discovery:** a counterexample may expose
  missing requirements, not merely a local defect; the loop must turn that into a
  new obligation rather than a false pass.

## Conclusion

What-if witness spaces change the shape of software hardening. They do not ask
an LLM whether a system is safe. They ask creative systems to generate dangerous
questions, then force every answer through deterministic, receipt-backed,
fail-closed checking.

The result is a bounded but honest assurance artifact. It can say what was
searched, what was blocked, what evidence failed, what was compressed, which
claim is open for research, and exactly where the claim stops. That boundary is
the useful product. It is what lets high-stakes software learn, optimize, and
promote new states without mistaking imagination for proof.
